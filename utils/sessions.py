class SessionFactory:

    A reusable factory for creating and managing a single `requests` session.

    The `SessionFactory` class ensures consistent behavior by maintaining a single
    `requests.Session` instance across multiple HTTP requests. This improves performance
    and allows shared configuration such as headers, cookies, or connection pooling.

    Attributes:
        session (requests.Session): The `requests.Session` instance managed by the factory.

    Methods:
        get():
            Returns the existing `requests.Session` instance or creates a new one if none exists.

        If a session does not already exist, a new `requests.Session` instance is created

        Returns:
            requests.Session: The managed `requests.Session` instance.

        Example Usage:
