Create a wide rectangular banner/header design for social media accounts.

---

## 📐 Dimensions
- Twitter/X header size: **1500 × 500 px**
- If exact size is unsupported, use a **3:1 aspect ratio**

---

## 🎨 Design Requirements
- **Do NOT include any logo.**
- The banner layout should follow this format:
  - A clean, modern esports-inspired design
  - A *large black bar* on the right side extending fully to the bottom-right corner (similar to the example style previously generated)
  - Left side should feature team colors and stylized shapes, without including the badge logo
- Use the Pittsburgh Penguins color palette:
  - **Primary:** #FCB514
  - **Secondary:** #000000
  - **Accent:** #FFFFFF
- Background elements should be subtle:
  - Soft diagonal stripes
  - Light halftone dots
  - Faint geometric overlays
  - Very light hockey-texture patterns

The overall visual style should remain **bold, clean, modern, high-contrast**, and consistent with esports branding.

---

## 🔤 Text to Include
Use bold, modern sans-serif text, all caps, strong contrast.

Main title:
- **PENGUINS GAME BOT**

Optional supporting text (include only if it enhances composition):
- **AUTOMATIC GAME UPDATES**
- **LIVE GOALS • STATS • HIGHLIGHTS**

Text should be placed cleanly over the black bar on the right side.

---

## 🚫 Do Not Include
- No logos (badge will be added manually later)
- No mascots, players, or photos
- No heavy gradients or metallic effects
- No clutter or chaotic background textures

---

## 📦 Final Output
- Provide the final banner as a **high-resolution PNG**
- Format should work cleanly as a Twitter/X header (safe zones respected)
- Maintain consistent modern branding throughout
