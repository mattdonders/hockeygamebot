class Team(object):
    """
    Represents an NHL team with attributes sourced from a predefined details dictionary.

    This class is designed to hold information about a specific NHL team, such as its
    name, hashtag, timezone, team ID, and primary/secondary colors. The team details
    are automatically populated based on the provided team name, using a helper function
    to look up the corresponding data.

    Attributes:
        full_name (str): The full name of the NHL team (e.g., "New Jersey Devils").
        hashtag (str): The team's associated social media hashtag (e.g., "#NJDevils").
        timezone (str): The timezone the team is based in (e.g., "America/New_York").
        team_id (int): The unique ID of the team.
        primary_color (str): The team's primary color in hexadecimal format (e.g., "#CE1126").
        secondary_color (str): The team's secondary color in hexadecimal format (e.g., "#000000").

    Methods:
        __str__(): Returns a human-readable string representation of the team.

    Raises:
        ValueError: If the team name is not found in the predefined team details dictionary.

    Example:
        home_team = Team("New Jersey Devils")
        print(home_team)  # Outputs: New Jersey Devils (#NJDevils)
